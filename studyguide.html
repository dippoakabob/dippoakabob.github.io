    <p>The test will be held<strong> in-class</strong> on <strong>Thursday November 5 </strong>and will be <strong>open-note</strong>; only hand-written notes may be used during the test &ndash; no printouts or screens.</p>
    <p><strong>Format:</strong> The exam will be the same format as Test 1 and consist of matching, multiple choice, short answer, and short essay items.&nbsp; Test materials will be provided for you, you do not need to purchase blue books or anything like that.</p>

Be able to describe distinctive cinematic features of the films and the basic plot of the films. Keep these questions in mind: what city or country is the film set in? what social issues are raised? what time period is in focus? is a particular historical event depicted? what major cinematic techniques are used in the film in important ways? how are these films representative of their respective &ldquo;waves&rdquo;?</p>

(Review the videos from the Oct 22 homework assignment and the Yale Film Analysis Guide if you are unsure of any of the above). Cinematic terms from the Part 1 (Russia / USSR) of the course are fair game for Test 2 as well; be sure to have terms listed in the study guide for Test 1 in your notes if you did poorly on that section on the last test.</p>
